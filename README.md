### 1D visualization

In 1D visualization, we use standard normal distribution as target, and use uniform distibution from [-10, 10] as input for generator. 


### 2D visualization

In 2D visualization, we use multivariate Gaussian distribution as target(mean_x=1.0, var_x=0.5, mean_y=0, var_y=1.5)
, and use uniform distibution from [-10, 10] as input for generator.
